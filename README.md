## Set up your Raspberry Pi
Make sure you have set up your Raspberry Pi. If not, you can follow the "Set_up.pdf" above to get ready to use.
## Overview
  A lot of people like to play guitar, violin and piano in their free
time. However, when we learn to play the instruments, it takes time to
turn the sheet music page from page.</br> 
  As a result, I want to develop an IoT device which can turn the
page automatically by sensing where the paragraph of music is
playing.</br> 
 This is device will pick out the 「dominant frequency 」of the
audio when we play the chords.
